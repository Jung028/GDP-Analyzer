These lines import necessary libraries and classes required for reading CSV files and converting Java collections to Scala collections.

'''
class GDPAnalyzerHelper(filePath: String) {
'''
This line defines a class named `GDPAnalyzerHelper` that takes a `filePath` parameter representing the path to the CSV file.

```scala
  def readGDPData(): List[(String, Double)] = {
```
This line declares a method named `readGDPData` that returns a list of tuples `(String, Double)`. The method reads the data from the CSV file and processes it to extract the GDP data.

```scala
    val reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(filePath))
    val lines = reader.readAll().asScala.toList
    reader.close()
```
These lines create a `CSVReader` object and read all the lines from the CSV file. The `asScala` method converts the Java collection to a Scala collection, and `toList` converts it to a list. Finally, the `close` method is called to close the reader.

```scala
    val gdpData: List[(String, Double)] = lines.tail.flatMap { line =>
      val country = line(1)
      val gdp = line(4).replaceAll(",", "").toDoubleOption
      gdp.map(country -> _)
    }
```
This line uses parametric polymorphism in the collection API. The `flatMap` method is applied to the `lines` collection, which represents each line of the CSV file. Within the `flatMap` function, each line is transformed into a tuple `(country, gdp)` by extracting the country name (`line(1)`) and GDP value (`line(4)`) after removing commas and converting it to a `Double` using `toDoubleOption`. The `flatMap` function discards the lines with invalid GDP values and flattens the resulting list of tuples.

```scala
    val filteredData = gdpData.filterNot { case (country, _) =>
      country == "Total, all countries or areas" || isRegion(country)
    }
```
This line uses the `filterNot` method to exclude specific countries from the `gdpData` list based on the country name. The `isRegion` method is called to determine if a country is a region and should be excluded.

```scala
    filteredData
  }
```
This line returns the filtered GDP data.

The remaining lines of code within the `GDPAnalyzerHelper` class follow a similar pattern of using the collection API for data manipulation. They involve parametric polymorphism in different contexts, such as filtering, grouping, mapping, and sorting. Here's a brief explanation of each method and its usage of parametric polymorphism:

- `readGDPDataMalaysia`: Reads GDP data specific to Malaysia and returns a list of tuples `(String, Double)`.

- `getExcludedRegions`: Reads excluded regions from a file and returns a set of strings.

- `findCountryWithHighestGDP`: Finds the country with the highest GDP from the given list of tuples `(String, Double)`.

- `isRegion`: Checks if a country name corresponds to a region by comparing it with a list of predefined regions.

- `calculateAverageGDPPerCapita`: Calculates the average GDP per capita for a given country using the data in the list of tuples `(String, Double)`.

- `findCountriesWithLowestAverageGDP`: Finds the specified number of countries with the lowest average GDP per capita from the given list of tuples `(String, Double)`.

The `GDPAnalyzer` object's `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `GDPAnalyzerHelper` class and calls various methods to perform analysis on GDP data. The usage of parametric polymorphism in the collection API allows the code to work with different data types, such as lists, tuples, and sets, while providing flexibility and reusability.
